<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a clone of the TaskRabbit application, specifically tailored for the African market (starting with Ivory Coast and Senegal).

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Core Flow:** Users (clients) should browse services, find available taskers, filter them (by distance, price, availability), and book them directly. This is a change from the initial implementation where clients posted jobs and taskers applied.
- **Bilingual Support:** The entire application must support both English and French.
- **User Roles:**
    - **Clients:** Can create accounts, search for taskers, book services, track tasker location, chat, and leave reviews.
    - **Taskers:** Can create accounts, set up their profile with services they offer, define their hourly rate, manage their availability, accept bookings, chat with clients, and be reviewed.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Service Categories:** A predefined, bilingual list of tasks (e.g., Home Repairs, Cleaning, Tutoring, Beauty Services).
    - **Real-time GPS Tracking:** Clients must be able to see the tasker's live location on a map with an ETA when they are en route.
    - **In-App Chat:** A real-time messaging system for communication between clients and taskers. Phone numbers should not be exchanged.
    - **Secure Payments:** Must support Cash, Orange Money, Wave, and PayPal.
    - **Reviews and Ratings:** Clients can review taskers after a job is completed.
- **Future Goal:** The application should be designed with a mobile-first approach, as the ultimate goal is to convert it into a mobile app.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React frontend using a MongoDB database.

The application has undergone a significant rebuild to match the TaskRabbit user flow.
- **Backend:** Models and API endpoints for users (clients/taskers), bilingual service categories, and direct bookings are in place. WebSocket endpoints for chat and GPS have been set up but are not fully implemented on the frontend.
- **Frontend:** The original job posting UI has been replaced with new pages for a direct booking flow: service selection, browsing taskers, and booking. However, the frontend is currently **broken** and will not compile due to syntax errors introduced during the rebuild.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** Fixing critical syntax errors in several newly created React components (, , and ) that are part of the major application rebuild.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** manual testing by curl
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1:** Frontend compilation failure (P0)

**Issues Detail:**
- **Issue 1:**
    - **Description:** The frontend build is failing with s in multiple files, including , , and . This makes the application completely unusable and un-previewable.
    - **Attempted fixes:** The agent has tried to fix the files by editing them and then by recreating them using  commands. These attempts failed because the agent repeatedly generated code with unescaped quotes and backslashes (e.g.,  and ), which are invalid in JSX strings.
    - **Next debug checklist:**
        1. View the contents of , , and  to identify all remaining syntax errors.
        2. Correct the invalid string literals. For French text with apostrophes (e.g., ), use proper JSX string syntax like  or template literals. For class names, use standard double quotes .
        3. Use  to apply all fixes at once to prevent further errors.
        4. Restart the frontend service: frontend: ERROR (not running)
frontend: started.
        5. Check the logs for compilation success: ==> /var/log/supervisor/frontend.err.log <==

==> /var/log/supervisor/frontend.out.log <==
yarn run v1.22.22
$ craco start.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is the highest priority blocker. Fixing it will make the frontend compile, allowing the new TaskRabbit flow to be tested for the first time.
    - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    - **Is recurring issue?** Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** frontend
    - **Blocked on other issue:** None. This issue is blocking all other progress.

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1:** Complete the TaskRabbit Flow Rebuild (P0)

**Task Detail:**
- **Task 1:**
    - **Where to resume:** After the compilation errors (Issue 1) are fixed, the agent must verify the end-to-end functionality of the new user flow:
        1. Client selects a service from .
        2. Client is redirected to  to see a list of relevant taskers.
        3. Client can filter taskers.
        4. Client can click to book a tasker, navigating to .
        5. Client completes booking and lands on a confirmation page .
        6. Bookings appear correctly in the new client and tasker dashboards (, ).
    - **What will be achieved with this?** The core user experience of the application will match the user's requirement of a TaskRabbit clone.
    - **Status:** BLOCKED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** both
    - **Blocked on something:** Issue 1: Frontend compilation failure.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - **P1: Implement Real-time GPS Tracking UI:** The backend WebSocket is ready. The frontend component  needs to be fully developed with a map (like Leaflet) to display the tasker's live location and integrated into the booking details page.
  - **P1: Implement In-App Chat UI:** The backend WebSocket is ready. The  component needs to be fully implemented to allow real-time messaging and integrated into the booking details page.
  - **P2: Tasker Profile Setup Flow:** The  page needs to be fully implemented to allow taskers to select their skills (categories), set their hourly rate, and define their availability.
  - **P2: Payment Flow Integration:** Implement the full payment flow on both the frontend and backend for Cash, Orange Money, Wave, and PayPal. This includes the UI for payment selection and API calls to process payments.
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **UI/UX Polish:** Conduct a full review of the application's UI to make it fancier and more professional, as requested by the user.
  - **Code Cleanup:** Remove deprecated files and components from the old job-posting flow (e.g., , ).

**Completed work in this session**
- **Recently completed:**
  - **Backend Restructure for TaskRabbit Flow:** The database models and API endpoints were modified to support direct booking of taskers instead of a job-board system.
  - **Initial Frontend Rebuild:** Created new pages and components for the TaskRabbit flow (, , , etc.). Note: This is the source of the current blocking issue.
  - **Bilingual Service Category Seeding:** The database was successfully seeded with a list of service categories in both English and French.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (with ), WebSockets, JWT Authentication
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, , 
- **Architecture:** Full-stack, REST APIs, WebSocket for real-time features.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The project's core logic was recently pivoted from a client posts a job model to a client books a tasker directly model (like TaskRabbit). As a result, many new frontend files have been created (, , etc.). The previous agent failed to generate these files with correct syntax, causing the entire frontend application to fail compilation. The immediate priority is to fix these syntax errors. The old dashboard files (, ) are now deprecated and should eventually be removed.

**Last 5 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1. **User:** Confirmed that a task can be posted but stated the flow is wrong. Described the desired TaskRabbit flow (select service -> browse taskers -> filter -> book) and provided example images.
2. **Agent:** Recommended a complete rebuild to match the TaskRabbit flow.
3. **User:** Agreed to the full rebuild and restated all core requirements (bilingual, chat, GPS, payments, service list).
4. **Agent:** Started the full rebuild.
5. **User:** Reported that the preview is not working and provided the frontend compilation error logs.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The frontend is not compiling due to syntax errors in multiple critical files.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** []
- **Known regressions:** The entire application is non-functional due to the frontend compilation failure.</analysis>
